# FEDS

Front-end Design System

## Purpose

Framework agnostic CSS library starter toolkit utilizing best practices

## Features

- Atomic (tachyons, short-hand syntax)
- Responsive (mobile first, container-queries)
- Component-based (versioning, themes)
- Intuitive Naming Conventions (BEM, OOCSS)
- Style Guide (autogenerated)
- Deployment friendly (autoprefixed, optimized, CDN integration)
- Standards based (Future proof, IDE friendly)

# Usage

    npm build [THEME]

Workflow is based around the auto generated style guide. Start the app, edit code and checkout the style guide at [localhost:1234](localhost:1234)

# Core Concepts

## Structure

- A `Theme` is a configuration of components
- A `Component` is a configuration of `Atoms`
- `Atoms` are extremely simple helper classes

## Rules Of Thumb

- Once you're happy with your `Atoms` you want to avoid ever having to change them again
- Once you establish a base theme you want to avoid ever having to change it again

## Workflow

Once you've established a base set of:

- Variables
- Atoms
- Components

You can create a theme:

- Themes automatically inherit the `base` theme
- You can overwrite components & variables to further customize your design

# How It Works

1.  Config is loaded (`app.json`)
2.  Atoms are loaded and compiled against variables
3.  Theme is loaded and is compiled against atoms
4.  Final stylesheet is generated which is:
    1.  autoprefixed
    2.  minified
    3.  mapped
5.  ..and contains (in order)
    1.  Normalize.css
    2.  Components
    3.  Atoms
6.  The following artifacts are produced:
    1.  [THEME]-[VERSION].css (css)
    2.  [THEME]-[VERSION].modules.css (modules file)
    3.  [THEME]-[VERSION].min.css (minified css)
    4.  [THEME]-[VERSION].css.map (minified map)
    5.  [THEME]-[VERSION].json (generation report)
