        Atoms are simple css classes designed to be aggregated together. A preset pattern of atoms is called a <em>Molecule</em>. Molecules are themselves css classes that serve as the base theme. For example: there exists a <em>.columns</em> class which is a composition of atoms based on flexbox. Applying the <em>.columns</em> class gives you everything you need out the box to work with a flexbox based grid. Atoms can then be further applied to elements to overwrite this default base theme behavior.
